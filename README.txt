I coded Hand Evaluation because when players play Poker there should be Evaluation who is win the game.
I joined team meeting and then my team mate give Hand Evaluation code working, so I agreed his ideas and then
I worked my part.
I am not sure my code will be good work but when I run my Eclips program that worked.
I communicate with team mate and then if I have a question I asked my team mate a lot of times.
I think my team work each their parts. and then we can share our code and information.
